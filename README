A link checker/site crawler which uses multiple processes to parallelise
and speed performance (where the number of processes spawned is
configurable).

Current usages is:

  perl linkCheckerP.pl <hostname>

  e.g. perl linkChecker.pl http://localhost/test.html

This will eventually be modularised and appear on CPAN :)
